# react-book-search
This application is built using react and it allows the user to search the google books API and view results for interesting books. This app was created for the MERN stack lesson, which is the 21st a final chapter in the JHU Fullstack Bookcamp. I worked hard to get this app to meet the initial specs for the assignment, it is still not fully complete at this point-the search input works to hit the API and render the response to the homepage but there is an error with the save feature that I have been able to resolve yet.
